# Monitoring Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information about the monitoring and observability features of the Global Electronics Lakehouse Dashboard.

## Overview

The dashboard includes three dedicated monitoring views that provide complete observability into system health, performance, and operations:

- **System Logs**: Application and system log aggregation with filtering and analysis
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Real-time alerts and notification management
- **Performance Metrics**: System performance monitoring and resource utilization

## System Logs View

### Features

- **Log Aggregation**: Collects logs from all application components
- **Level Filtering**: Filter by ERROR, WARNING, INFO, and DEBUG levels
- **Time-based Filtering**: View logs from Last Hour, Last 24 Hours, Last 7 Days, or All time
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Overview of log volume and error rates
- **Detailed View**: Expandable log details with full context

### Log Sources

Logs are collected from:
- Application runtime logs (`_logs/generate_data.log`)
- Data service operations
- Pipeline execution logs
- System monitoring events

### Log Format

```
2025-10-06 15:25:06,038 - ERROR - Data generation failed: Seed must be non-negative
```

Fields:
- **Timestamp**: ISO format with milliseconds
- **Level**: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
- **Message**: Log content
- **Source**: Component or file generating the log

### Troubleshooting with Logs

#### Common Error Patterns

1. **Data Generation Errors**
   ```
   ERROR - Data generation failed: Seed must be non-negative
   ```
   **Solution**: Check random seed configuration in data generation scripts

2. **Connection Errors**
   ```
   ERROR - Failed to connect to Databricks: [error details]
   ```
   **Solution**: Verify Databricks credentials and network connectivity

3. **Pipeline Failures**
   ```
   ERROR - Pipeline execution failed: [pipeline name]
   ```
   **Solution**: Check pipeline configuration and upstream dependencies

## Alerts & Notifications View

### Alert Types

- **Trigger**: Pipeline status changes to Warning or Error
- **Severity**: WARNING/ERROR
- **Action**: Review pipeline logs and restart if necessary

#### System Resource Alerts
- **Memory Usage**: Alerts when >80% memory utilization
- **CPU Usage**: Alerts when >90% CPU utilization
- **Disk Space**: Alerts when <10% free space

#### Data Quality Alerts
- **Inventory Alerts**: Triggered by reorder requirements
- **Data Completeness**: Missing or incomplete data detection

### Alert Management

#### Status Levels
- **Active**: Requires immediate attention
- **Acknowledged**: Under investigation
- **Resolved**: Issue has been addressed

#### Response Procedures

1. **Critical Alerts (ERROR level)**
   - Immediate investigation required
   - Escalate to on-call engineer
   - Document incident response

2. **Warning Alerts**
   - Review within 1 hour
   - Assess impact on operations
   - Plan remediation

3. **Info Alerts**
   - Monitor trends
   - Address if pattern emerges

## Performance Metrics View

### Key Metrics

#### Query Performance
- **Average Query Time**: Target <3 seconds
- **Query Count**: Transactions per hour
- **Slow Queries**: Queries >5 seconds
- **Failed Queries**: Error rate tracking

#### Pipeline Performance
- **Runtime**: Average execution time by pipeline
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful runs
- **SLA Compliance**: Meeting time requirements

#### System Resources
- **CPU Usage**: Current utilization percentage
- **Memory Usage**: RAM utilization and trends
- **Disk Usage**: Storage capacity monitoring
- **Network I/O**: Data transfer rates

### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Query Time (avg) | <3s | <5s | >10s |
| CPU Usage | <70% | <85% | >95% |
| Memory Usage | <75% | <90% | >95% |
| Pipeline Success | >95% | >90% | <85% |

## Configuration

### Alert Configuration

Configure alerting channels in `dashboard/config/__init__.py`:

```python
alerting = {
    'email': {
        'enabled': True,
        'smtp_server': 'smtp.company.com',
        'smtp_port': 587,
        'from': 'alerts@company.com',
        'to': 'team@company.com',
        'username': 'alerts@company.com',
        'password': 'secure_password'
    },
    'webhook': {
        'enabled': True,
        'url': 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/...',
        'headers': {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    }
}
```

### Log Configuration

Logs are stored in the `_logs/` directory with rotation:

- **Max file size**: 10MB
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Format**: Standard Python logging format

### Monitoring Intervals

- **Real-time**: Pipeline status, active alerts
- **5-minute intervals**: System resources, query performance
- **Hourly**: Log aggregation, trend analysis
- **Daily**: Performance reports, capacity planning

## Best Practices

### Proactive Monitoring

1. **Set up Alert Thresholds**
   - Configure appropriate warning and critical thresholds
   - Regularly review and adjust based on normal operations

2. **Monitor Trends**
   - Track performance over time
   - Identify patterns that may indicate future issues

3. **Log Analysis**
   - Regularly review error logs for recurring issues
   - Set up log aggregation and alerting for critical errors

### Incident Response

1. **Alert Triage**
   - Assess alert severity and impact
   - Determine if immediate action is required

2. **Investigation**
