# DSP Implementation of IIR Filters (Implementarea pe DSP a filtrelor IIR)

> University project archived for my public portfolio.

## Overview
Design and implement IIR filters (Butterworth/Chebyshev/Elliptic) and deploy using a DSP-friendly structure (biquad cascade).
Covers coefficient quantization, fixed‑point considerations, stability, and measured/estimated frequency response.

## Tech stack
- MATLAB/Octave for design; C/C++ or Python for fixed-point simulation; optional embedded/DSP target

## Project layout
```
src/        # executable scripts/functions
docs/       # notes, exported coefficients, derivations
data/       # small sample inputs (keep under 10 MB)
results/    # figures/outputs generated by the code
```
*(Empty folders are kept with .gitkeep.)*

## How to run
Design:
  - Run `src/design_iir.m` to export SOS/biquad coefficients to `docs/coefficients.csv`.
Simulation (Python):
  - `pip install numpy scipy`
  - `python src/fixed_point_sim.py`

## Tasks / Checklist
- Filter design in MATLAB/Octave: low/high/band types with user-defined specs (Fp, Fs, Ap, As).
- Realization: Direct Form II Transposed biquads with scaling to avoid overflow.
- Quantization strategies: Q15/Q31; noise gain & pole-zero sensitivity checks.
- Validation: frequency response (Bode), step/impulse response, and THD for a test tone.
- (Optional) Hardware: integrate with CMSIS-DSP or vendor SDK and measure real-time behavior.

## Notes
- This repo was reconstructed from an older university assignment; sensitive data removed.
- Large binaries should be handled via **Git LFS** if added.
- License: MIT (see `LICENSE`).
