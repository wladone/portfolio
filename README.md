# Signal Autocorrelation (Autocorelația semnalului)

> University project archived for my public portfolio.

## Overview
Compute and analyze the discrete autocorrelation Rxx[k] of 1D signals.
Includes naive O(N^2) and FFT-based (Wiener–Khinchin) estimators, biased/unbiased normalization, and use-cases such as periodicity detection and SNR estimation.

## Tech stack
- MATLAB/Octave or Python (NumPy/Matplotlib)

## Project layout
```
src/        # executable scripts/functions
docs/       # notes, exported coefficients, derivations
data/       # small sample inputs (keep under 10 MB)
results/    # figures/outputs generated by the code
```
*(Empty folders are kept with .gitkeep.)*

## How to run
MATLAB:
  - Run `src/main.m` to generate figures in `results/`.
Python:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create if needed)
  - `python src/main.py`

## Tasks / Checklist
- Implement both naive and FFT-based autocorrelation; compare speed and numerical differences.
- Support lags up to N-1, with `biased` vs `unbiased` and `coeff` ([-1,1]) normalization.
- Test on: pure sine, sine+noise, square wave, and a short speech clip (optional).
- Plot ACF, highlight principal lags/period; estimate fundamental frequency where relevant.

## Notes
- This repo was reconstructed from an older university assignment; sensitive data removed.
- Large binaries should be handled via **Git LFS** if added.
- License: MIT (see `LICENSE`).
