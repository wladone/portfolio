# Analog Modulations (AM, DSB‑SC, SSB, FM/PM)

> University project archived for my public portfolio.

## Overview
Simulate generation and demodulation of classical analog modulations.
Explore spectra, modulation index, bandwidth (Carson’s rule), and SNR vs. m (AM) or β (FM).

## Tech stack
- MATLAB/Octave or Python (NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib)

## Project layout
```
src/        # executable scripts/functions
docs/       # notes, exported coefficients, derivations
data/       # small sample inputs (keep under 10 MB)
results/    # figures/outputs generated by the code
```
*(Empty folders are kept with .gitkeep.)*

## How to run
MATLAB:
  - Run `src/run_all.m` to produce plots in `results/`.
Python:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create if needed)
  - `python src/run_all.py`

## Tasks / Checklist
- Implement AM (full carrier), DSB-SC, SSB (Hilbert/phasor) and FM/PM generation + coherent/envelope demod.
- Plot time/frequency domain (FFT) and annotate sidebands.
- Sweep modulation index; evaluate distortion and SNR; compare analytical expectations.
- (Optional) Add channel noise and pre‑emphasis/de‑emphasis for FM.

## Notes
- This repo was reconstructed from an older university assignment; sensitive data removed.
- Large binaries should be handled via **Git LFS** if added.
- License: MIT (see `LICENSE`).
